# Class 1 Notes

**Why Markdown?
- HTML gives you significant control, but slows down authoring

- Markdown is a lightweight markup language for generating html files

- It is not a what you see is what you get editor. (WYSIWYG) 

- Instead it uses textual symbols to indicate the structure of the page

**For example:

"# This is a heading"     			>>>		This is a heading

- GitHub uses Markdown pretty much everywhere:

- Top level README.md files are auto-rendered

- Any other .md files

- Issues, comments, code reviews, etcâ€¦

# **Growth Mindset**

>Growth Mindset is a way of thinking to always have an avenue forward - never think that you have come to a deadend and know that with resolve you can keep moving forward.

1. Remember the bowl of popcorn: not every kernel pops at once, but they will all pop in their own time.
2. Remember at the end of the day I learned something new and still moved forward.
3. Never give up.  Use the 15 minute rule.  I can do this.
