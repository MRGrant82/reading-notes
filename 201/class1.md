# **Getting started with the web**

* The web consists of a collection of interconnected documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs.
* The web is built on three main technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* HTML is used to create the content and structure of web pages, CSS is used for presentation and layout, and JavaScript is used for interactivity and functionality.
* To create web pages, you need a text editor and a web browser.
* Web developers use a variety of tools and technologies, such as version control systems, package managers, and build tools.
* To learn more about web development, you can use online resources like MDN Web Docs, and join online communities and forums.

# **How the Web works**

* The web is a client-server system, where clients (such as web browsers) request resources from servers, which send back responses.
* The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used for communication between clients and servers.
* URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) are used to identify resources on the web.
* Web servers use software like Apache or Nginx to handle requests and responses.
* Web browsers use rendering engines like Gecko or Blink to display web pages.
* When you click on a link or type in a URL, your web browser sends a request to the server, which responds with the requested resource.
* The web uses a range of technologies and standards, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTTP, and DNS.

# **What will your website look like**

* The design of a website is important for attracting and retaining visitors.
* Good design involves factors like visual appeal, usability, accessibility, and responsiveness.
* Designing a website involves making decisions about layout, color scheme, typography, imagery, and other visual elements.
* Wireframing and prototyping tools can help you plan the layout and structure of your website.
* Testing and iterating on your design is important to ensure it meets the needs of your users.
* The design of your website should reflect your brand and your target audience.

# **Introduction to HTML: Getting started**

* HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and is used to create the content and structure of web pages.
* HTML consists of a series of elements, which are surrounded by angle brackets (< >) and may contain attributes.
* Elements can be nested inside other elements, forming a hierarchical structure.
* HTML documents begin with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration, followed by an <html> element containing a <head> and a <body>.
* The <head> element contains metadata about the document, such as the title and links to CSS and JavaScript files.
* The <body> element contains the visible content of the document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

# **Introduction to HTML: Document and website structure**

* HTML documents have a hierarchical structure, with a root <html> element, and nested elements inside it.
* HTML elements can have attributes, which provide additional information about the element.
* HTML documents should be well-structured and semantically meaningful.
* Semantics refers to the meaning and purpose of the content on a web page.
* Good HTML structure and semantics are important for accessibility, SEO, and maintenance.
* HTML provides a range of structural elements, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables, that can be used to organize content.

# **Introduction to HTML: The head metadata in HTML**

* The <head> element in an HTML document contains metadata about the document, such as the title, description, and keywords.
* The title element is displayed in the browser's title bar and is also used by search engines to understand the content of the page.
* The description and keywords elements provide additional information to search engines.
* The <link> element is used to link to external resources, such as CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files.
* The <style> element is used to define CSS rules directly in the HTML document.
* The <meta> element is used to provide additional information about the document, such as the author, language, and character encoding.

# **Thinking before coding**

* Before starting to code a website, it's important to plan and think about the design and functionality you want to achieve.
* This involves considering factors such as the purpose of the website, the target audience, the content, and the desired user experience.
* Wireframing and prototyping tools can help you visualize and plan the layout and structure of your website.
* It's important to prioritize accessibility and usability in your design, to ensure that your website is usable by as many people as possible.
* Testing and iterating on your design is important to ensure that it meets the needs of your users and achieves your goals.
* Good planning and design can save time and effort in the long run, and help you create a successful and effective website.

# **Semantics**

* Semantics refers to the meaning and purpose of the content on a web page, and how it relates to other content on the page and on the web.
* Good semantic HTML structure is important for accessibility, SEO, and maintenance.
* HTML provides a range of semantic elements, such as <article>, <header>, <footer>, and <nav>, that can be used to define the purpose and context of content.
* Using semantic elements makes it easier for assistive technologies like screen readers to understand the structure and meaning of the content.
* Semantic HTML also helps search engines understand the content and purpose of the page, which can improve search rankings.
* Good use of semantics can also make your code more maintainable and easier to work with.

# **What is JavaScript?**

* JavaScript is a programming language used to add interactivity and functionality to web pages.
* JavaScript code is executed by the browser, and can be used to manipulate the content and behavior of web pages in response to user interactions.
* JavaScript can be used to validate user input, create animations and effects, load content dynamically, and communicate with web servers.
* JavaScript code can be included in HTML documents using the <script> element, or in external JavaScript files that are linked to the HTML document.
* JavaScript is a high-level language that is easy to learn, and has a large and active community of developers.
* JavaScript is a core technology of the web, and is used extensively in web development.

# **Ubuntu Terminal Commands**

* cd - Changes the current working directory. For example, cd /home/username changes the current directory to /home/username.
* ls - Lists the contents of the current directory. For example, ls -l shows a detailed list of files and directories in the current directory.
* mkdir - Creates a new directory. For example, mkdir my_folder creates a new directory called my_folder.
* touch - Creates a new file or updates the modification time of an existing file. For example, touch my_file.txt creates a new file called my_file.txt.
* cp - Copies a file or directory from one location to another. For example, cp file.txt /home/username/destination copies file.txt to /home/username/destination.
* mv - Moves a file or directory from one location to another. For example, mv file.txt /home/username/destination moves file.txt to /home/username/destination.
* rm - Removes a file or directory. For example, rm file.txt removes file.txt.
* sudo - Allows you to execute a command with administrative privileges. For example, sudo apt-get update updates the system package list.
* grep - Searches for a pattern in a file or output. For example, grep "error" logfile.txt searches for the word "error" in logfile.txt.
* man - Displays the manual page for a command. For example, man ls shows the manual page for the ls command.

# **CRUD**

* Create - Creates new data and adds it to the database. For example, creating a new user account in a system.
* Read - Reads the data from the database. For example, displaying a user's profile information on a website.
* Update - Modifies existing data in the database. For example, updating a user's password or email address.
* Delete - Removes existing data from the database. For example, deleting a user's account.
