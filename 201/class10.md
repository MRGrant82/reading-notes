# Notes on Browser Developer Tools and Debugging CSS and JavaScript

## What Went Wrong

- This section covers common errors in JavaScript and how to use browser developer tools to debug them.
- Some common errors include syntax errors, runtime errors, and logical errors.
- Browser developer tools can help identify errors by displaying error messages in the console and allowing you to set breakpoints and step through code.

## What are Browser Developer Tools?

- Browser developer tools are built-in tools in web browsers that allow developers to inspect and debug web pages.
- The tools include a variety of features such as a console, network inspector, and the JavaScript debugger.
- The JavaScript debugger allows you to step through your code line by line, set breakpoints, and evaluate expressions.
- The network inspector allows you to monitor network traffic and see how your web page is loading.

## Debugging CSS

- This section covers how to use browser developer tools to debug CSS.
- Common issues with CSS include incorrect selectors, conflicting styles, and specificity issues.
- The browser developer tools allow you to inspect the CSS for an element, see which styles are being applied, and test changes in real-time.
- You can also use the "computed" tab to see how the styles are being computed and the "console" tab to test CSS selectors and evaluate expressions.

# Answers to Questions on Debugging CSS and JavaScript

## Key Differences between Syntax Error and Logic Error

- Syntax errors are rule violations; logic errors produce unexpected results.
- Syntax errors appear as error messages, while logic errors require debugging tools.

## Types of Errors and How to Correct Them

- In past assignments, I corrected undefined variables, syntax errors, and logical errors.
- I identified the errors with the browser developer tools and made corrections in the code.

## Influence on Long-term Goals

- Debugging skills are essential for software development and will continue to be important in my long-term goals.
- Efficient error identification and correction are crucial to delivering high-quality software.

## Description of the JavaScript Debugger Tool

- The JavaScript debugger is a browser tool that allows you to inspect variables and behavior line by line, set breakpoints, and evaluate expressions.
- It works by pausing code execution at specified points, allowing for inspection and modification.

## Definition of Breakpoint

- A breakpoint is a point in the code where the debugger pauses execution, allowing for code behavior inspection and identification of issues.
- Breakpoints can be set manually or using the `debugger` statement in the code.

## Definition of Call Stack

- The call stack is a data structure used by browsers to keep track of the current execution context of the code.
- It stores a list of function calls, with the most recent call at the top of the stack.
- The stack is updated when a function is called or returned.
