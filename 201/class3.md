**The "ul" element in HTML is used to create unordered lists.**

**To create an unordered list using the "ul" element, the list items should be enclosed in "li" elements.**

**The "ul" element attributes that can be used to modify its appearance, including the "type" attribute, which allows you to specify the type of bullet point to use.**

**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to create web pages.**

**HTML documents are structured using tags, which are enclosed in angled brackets (< >).**

**HTML elements can have attributes, which provide additional information about the element.**

**HTML documents are structured using a hierarchy of elements, with the "html" element at the top and other elements nested inside it.**

**The "ol" element in HTML is used to create ordered lists.**

**To create an ordered list using the "ol" element, the list items should be enclosed in "li" elements.**

**The "ol" element has a few attributes that can be used to modify its appearance, including the "type" attribute, which allows you to specify the type of numbering to use.**

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of HTML documents.**

**CSS rules are made up of a selector and a declaration block, which contains one or more declarations.**

**Declarations consist of a property and a value, which together define how an element should be styled.**

**CSS can be applied to HTML documents in a number of ways, including using internal stylesheets, external stylesheets, and inline styles.**

**The CSS box model is used to describe the layout of HTML elements.**

**Each element on a web page is considered to be inside a rectangular box, with properties for content, padding, border, and margin.**

**The "box-sizing" property can be used to modify how the size of an element is calculated, taking into account the padding and border, or only the content.**

**JavaScript is a programming language used to add interactivity to web pages.**

**JavaScript can be used to manipulate HTML and CSS, handle events, and perform calculations.**

**JavaScript can be added to HTML documents using the "script" element, which can be placed in the "head" or "body" of the document. (Personally I prefer it to be in the body so the page loads faster)**

**JavaScript can be written directly in HTML documents or in separate JavaScript files that are linked to the HTML document.**

**Arrays are a type of data structure in JavaScript that can be used to store and manipulate collections of data.**

**Arrays can be created using square brackets and can contain any type of data, including other arrays.**

**Arrays have a number of methods that can be used to manipulate their contents, such as "push", "pop", "shift", and "unshift".**

**Understanding arrays is an important part of working with data in JavaScript.**

**Expressions and operators in JavaScript are used to perform calculations and other operations on values.**

**JavaScript has a number of different types of expressions and operators, including arithmetic operators, comparison operators, and logical operators.**

**Expressions can be used to assign values to variables, compare values, and perform other operations.**

**Conditional statements in JavaScript are used to execute different code depending on a condition.**

**The "if" statement is used to execute code if a condition is true, and the "else" statement is used to execute code if the condition is false.**

**The "switch" statement can be used to execute different code depending on the value of a variable.**

**Loops in JavaScript are used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times or until a condition is met.**

**The "for" loop is used to execute a block of code a specific number of times.**

**The "while" loop is used to execute a block of code while a condition is true.**

**The "do...while" loop is similar to the "while" loop, but it always executes the block of code at least once.**

# **Reading Questions03**

**When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?**

* To group related items together in no particular order.

**How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?**

* "list-style-type" property in CSS.

**When should you use an ordered list vs an unordered list in your HTML document?**

* To group related items together in a specific order.

**Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list in HTML.**

* Using the "start" attribute or the "type" attribute.

**Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?**

* Padding is like a cushion that goes around an element, while margin is like a buffer zone that goes around an element. Their role in the story is to create space around and between the elements on the page.

**List and describe the four parts of an HTML element's box as referred to by the box model.**

* Content area: area inside the element where the content is displayed.

* Padding area: area surrounding the content area, which provides space between the content and the border of the element.

* Border area: area surrounding the padding area, which defines the boundary of the element.

* Margin area: area surrounding the border area, which provides space between the element and other elements on the page.

**What data types can you store inside of an Array?**

* Strings, numbers, booleans, objects, and other arrays.

**Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?**

* Yes, it is a valid JavaScript array. You can access the values stored using the array index and element index.

**List five shorthand operators for assignment in JavaScript and describe what they do.**

* +=, -=, *=, /=, and %= perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo arithmetic.

**Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.**

* The result would be the string "10falsedog" because the expression first adds the numeric value of "a" and the boolean value of "c", and then concatenates the resulting numeric value with the string value of "b".
