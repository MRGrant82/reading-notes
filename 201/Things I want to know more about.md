Three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams are:
Dependability - team members can depend on each other to do quality work on time
Structure and Clarity - clear goals, roles, and plans
Psychological Safety - team members feel safe to take risks and be vulnerable around each other
In a previous team I was in, we had a high degree of psychological safety.
We were able to openly express our thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment, and we supported each other through challenges.
This led to a stronger sense of team cohesion and trust, which in turn allowed us to be more productive and innovative in our work.
Teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have a positive impact on their company and team members.
Team members feel more engaged and satisfied, which can lead to higher retention rates and better overall performance.
Companies benefit from increased creativity and innovation, as team members feel comfortable taking risks and suggesting new ideas.
