* HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, which is used to create web pages.
* HTML documents are made up of HTML elements, which are enclosed in opening and closing tags.
* The basic structure of an HTML document includes the html, head, and body elements.
* HTML tags can be used to create headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more.

* HTML text can be formatted using various tags, including headings (h1-h6), paragraphs (p), and line breaks (br).
* Text can also be emphasized or emphasized strongly using the em and strong tags, respectively.
* Other formatting tags include the del and ins tags for strikethrough and underlined text, and the small tag for smaller text.

# **https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Advanced_text_formatting**

* Advanced text formatting in HTML includes using the mark tag to highlight text, the sub and sup tags to format subscript and superscript text, and the pre tag to preserve whitespace and formatting.
* HTML also supports special characters, such as copyright and trademark symbols, using character entities.

* CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style HTML documents.
* CSS consists of rulesets, which include a selector (identifying which HTML element(s) the rule applies to) and a declaration block (containing one or more declarations that define the style properties and      values for the selected element(s)).
* CSS can be included in an HTML document using the style element or an external stylesheet.

* JavaScript is a programming language used to add interactivity to web pages.
* JavaScript can be included in an HTML document using the script element, either inline or in an external file.
* JavaScript includes various data types, such as strings, numbers, and booleans, as well as arrays and objects.

# **https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals**

* Conditionals in JavaScript allow for executing different code based on whether a condition is true or false.
* Conditional statements include the if statement, which executes code if a condition is true, and the if...else statement, which executes one set of code if the condition is true and another set of code if the condition is false.
* JavaScript also includes comparison and logical operators for creating more complex conditions.

# **Primitive data types**

* Number: represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
* String: represents text values, enclosed in single or double quotes.
* Boolean: represents a logical value, either true or false.
* Undefined: represents a value that has not been defined or assigned.
* Null: represents an intentional absence of any object value.
* Symbol: represents a unique and immutable identifier.

# **Conditional logic**

* If statement: Allows you tun run a block of code if condition is true.
* Else statement: Use with an if statement to run a different block of code if the condition of the if statement is false.
* Else if statement: You use this to check multiple conditions.
* Switch statement: Allows you to run different blocks of code based on the variable value.
* Ternary operator: A shorthand way to write an if/else statement
