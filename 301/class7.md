Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine is an open-source JavaScript engine that powers the Chrome browser and is designed to execute JavaScript code at high speeds.

Node being a JavaScript runtime means it allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

npm is a package manager for Node.js that allows developers to easily install and manage third-party libraries or packages.

To install a library/package called 'jshint', one can type the command "npm install jshint" in the terminal.

Node.js is used for building scalable network applications and server-side applications.

The 6 reasons for pair programming are: increased efficiency, improved code quality, enhanced learning, better team communication, increased job satisfaction, and reduced knowledge silos.

In my experience, improved code quality and enhanced learning are the most beneficial reasons for pair programming.

Pair programming works by having two developers work together on a single computer, where one is the "driver" who types the code, and the other is the "navigator" who reviews the code and gives feedback.

- To check the version of Node.js, use the command `node -v` in the terminal or command prompt
- To check the version of npm, use the command `npm -v` in the terminal or command prompt

- Pair programming involves two developers working together on a single computer
- One developer acts as the "driver" who types the code, while the other acts as the "navigator" who reviews the code and provides feedback
- The benefits of pair programming include increased efficiency, improved code quality, enhanced learning, better team communication, increased job satisfaction, and reduced knowledge silos
- Pair programming can help improve code quality by allowing for real-time code review and catching errors early on in the development process
- Pair programming can also help enhance learning by providing opportunities for knowledge sharing and skill development
