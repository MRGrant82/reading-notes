# Class 1 Notes

**Why Markdown?
- HTML gives you significant control, but slows down authoring
- Markdown is a lightweight markup language for generating html files
- It is not a what you see is what you get editor. (WYSIWYG) 
- Instead it uses textual symbols to indicate the structure of the page

**For example:


"# This is a heading"     			>>>		This is a heading

- GitHub uses Markdown pretty much everywhere:
- Top level README.md files are auto-rendered
- Any other .md files
- Issues, comments, code reviews, etcâ€¦
