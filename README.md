##Growth Mindset##

>Growth Mindset is a way of thinking to always have an avenue forward - never think that you have come to a deadend and know that with resolve you can keep moving forward.

1. Remember the bowl of popcorn: not every kernel pops at once, but they will all pop in their own time.
2. Remember at the end of the day I learned something new and still moved forward.
3. Never give up.  Use the 15 minute rule.  I can do this.
